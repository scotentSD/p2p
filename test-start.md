**Enter information about you**
- we won't display your full name or your email address
- most of the fields are not mandatory
- if you do not provide a picture, Slack will provide a random avatar
- you could **add your company name at the end of your display name** so others can easily see who you work for (example: Jo_Wilson_MyOrganisationName) 

> Some information like **What I do**, or **your organisation/company's name** are optional, but telling a bit more about yourself encourage people to engage with you as they will know where you are speaking from.
